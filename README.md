# apache2-access-log-parser
Python script that parses through *apache2* **access_log** files, extracts information such as:

* IP address
* Access Time
* Requested Resource
* Users' Browser

and stores it inside a customizable .csv file.

<h2>How to Use<h2>
  1. Download access_log from your apache2 server (*found in /var/log/apache2*) 
  2. Put the file in the same directory as *parser.py*
  3. Double-click on the .py file, sit back, and watch it do it's magic.
